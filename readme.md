# Automated CSV Report Generator - ProSensia Python Internship - Day 18

## 🎯 Goal
This project aims to demonstrate skills in reading, processing, and summarizing structured data using Python. [cite_start]It was completed as part of the ProSensia Python Internship, Day 18 task[cite: 3, 5].

## 📄 Task Overview
The core task involved building a Python script to:
* [cite_start]Read sales data from a CSV file[cite: 12].
* [cite_start]Calculate total sales, total revenue, and identify the top-selling product[cite: 13].
* [cite_start]Save the summarized results into a `report.txt` file[cite: 14].

## 📁 Dataset Example
[cite_start]The script processes data similar to the `sales_data.csv` example provided in the task, which includes columns like `Date`, `Product`, `Units Sold`, and `Unit Price`[cite: 7, 8, 9, 10].

A sample of the data used:
```csv
Date,Product,Units Sold,Unit Price
2025-07-01,Keyboard,5,1200
2025-07-01,Mouse,10,700
2025-07-02,Laptop,2,85000
